# 📓 Book Journal Studio

A modern, customizable journal platform for thinkers, planners, and creators—built with Vue.js, Nuxt, TailwindCSS, Flowbite, and TypeScript.  

> "Not just a book. It's an extension of your mind."

## 🧠 Concept

**Book Journal Studio** is a powerful Progressive Web App (PWA) that lets users discover, personalize, and purchase themed book journals. These journals range from wealth planners for Gen Z financiers, to book wisdom trackers for non-fiction readers, thought therapy journals for wellness seekers, and content ideation logs for creators.

The project aims to blend tactile analog value (handwritten journaling) with a rich, dopamine-rewarding digital companion. Built for fast delivery in Nairobi (under 48hrs), it also includes subtle AI integrations to drive retention, identity anchoring, and user habit loops.

## 💡 Validation Strategy

Before scaling, we use a **validation hack** method:

- Live MVP landing page to gauge interest
- Ads targeting specific groups (e.g., Gen Z, financiers, readers)
- Pre-order survey via forms
- Prototype journals through a small local batch
- Conversion analytics + user interviews
